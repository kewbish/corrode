# corrode
Made in Vim, September 2020.  
Created by [Kewbish](https://github.com/kewbish), forked from [tomasiser/vim-code-dark](https://github.com/tomasiser/vim-code-dark).

## About
A very minimal grey colo[u]rscheme for Vim. Forked from tomasiser/vim-code-dark, I only edited the colours.  
I wanted to try a colour-free existence in Vim. I decided I liked it. This scheme is the result.

Looks something like [this is markdown]:

> :warning: Haven't tested on 8/16 terminals. It's entirely possible it doesn't look the best on non-256 colour terminals, but anyhow, it's nice and greyscale.
