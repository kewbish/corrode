# corrode
Made in Vim, September 2020.

## About
A very minimal grey colo[u]rscheme for Vim. Forked from tomasiser/vim-code-dark.
I wanted to try a colour-free existence in Vim. I decided I liked it. This scheme is the result.

Looks something like [this is markdown]:

> :warning: Doesn't work in gVim - don't use it and didn't bother to edit it [yet]. Also haven't tested on 8/16 terminals - only on a 256 colour one. Probably is very broken at the moment, I will attempt to fix most of the colours soon.

## Installation
Use your favourite plugin manager.

For vim-plug:
```vim
Plug 'kewbish/corrode'
```

If you wish to download this manually, `git clone` it and drop the `colors/corrode.vim` file into your `.vim/colors` directory.

Then, add:
```vim
colorscheme corrode
```
